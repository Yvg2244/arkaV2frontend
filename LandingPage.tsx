          diverse talent for various needs, leading to management issues and
          inefficiencies.

                        <h2 className="font-[700] my-2">Introduction:</h2>
                        <p>
                          EliteGroup Finances started with a simple but
                          in-demand service, ‘Company’s financial audits’. The
                          company had been an offline firm for quite a while and
                          they were looking for online expansion. So when we
                          received their lead, we knew we had a real opportunity
                          to showcase the skills we have acquired over a period
                          of 1.5 years. We had an opportunity to take a
                          completely off-the-grid company to the vast world of
                          digital media.

                        <p>
                          Transitioning from an offline to an online business
                          model presented several challenges for EliteGroup
                          Finances:

                            <strong>Limited Online Presence:</strong> Initially,
                            the company had minimal digital footprint, lacking a
                            website, social media presence, and online marketing

                          <li>
                            <strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> Lack of

                            branding, and digital marketing posed a significant
                            hurdle.

                          <li>
                            <strong>Brand Adaptation:</strong> Adapting the
                            established offline brand identity to the online
                            environment while maintaining credibility and

                        <p>
                          Mr. Mboso started as a software engineer but soon
                          realized entrepreneurship was his true calling. He
                          approached us after observing us on Instagram, telling
                          us that he liked our designs and would like to offer
                          us some work. He explained to us that he wanted his
                          Instagram page to attract people and get them
                          interested in his website where he sold coffee. He
                          didn’t share much about his business model as the only
                          service he was looking for was designing his Instagram
                          posts. So, he gave us specific ideas and we started
                          working on design. We provided him with a few options,
                          and he finalized a certain design. We started making
                          posts for him and it went on for a few weeks. There
                          was an impressive rise in his following and likes and
                          we thought everything was going fine. But, one day out
                          of nowhere, Mboso told us he no longer needed our
                          services. This came as a big shock to us as everything
                          was going great. We wanted to know the reason behind
                          this, so we asked Mboso for an online meeting. Mboso
                          agreed and there he told us what was wrong.

                        <h2 className="font-[700] my-2">Challenges:</h2>
                        <p>
                          While working as a software engineer, amidst the hum
                          of technology and the glow of computer screens, Mboso
                          found solace in a simple pleasure: coffee. He was not
                          your typical office coffee lover. He went every year
                          to Ethiopia to bring the best coffee beans and brewed
                          them himself in his expensive brewing machine. While
                          his hands and mind worked monotonously writing codes,
                          when that aroma of coffee filled his nostrils, when
                          the cup came to his sight and when the taste of coffee
                          reached his tongue, he became alive! Moboso knew, that
                          writing codes wasn’t something he could do for long
                          but the ever-present question of “what then?” still
                          hovered over his head.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          One rainy evening as Mboso was enjoying the perfect
                          sips of his self-brewed coffee watching the rain
                          outside, a flash of lightning struck the sky and so
                          did an idea in Moboso’s head. He finally knew what he
                          had to do! He decided to become an entrepreneur and
                          sell coffee. He soon quit his job and with his
                          savings, started brewing the first batch of “Mboso’s
                          Taste”. As he hired people to set up a website and
                          listed his products online, his savings soon started
                          to puff away.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          But as you know, the world is not all sweets and
                          greenery. Mboso, at the start, was steady with his
                          sales but soon everything slowed down. So Mboso
                          thought about attracting more clients through social
                          media but had no idea how things worked. He thought
                          making attractive posts about his coffee was enough to
                          generate traffic to his website, but as the story
                          played itself, that wasn’t the case. After listening
                          to all this, we knew we could help. He needed services
                          that we had and that was the only way to save a dream,
                          to save a person who otherwise would have to go back
                          to something that pushed him to the edge.

                            research and figured out what made Mboso’s coffee
                            better than the already available options in their

                            Mboso’s story itself was an amazing selling point.
                            The few minutes of luxury of sipping coffee between
                            deadlines and lengthy codes was not just Mboso’s
                            thing. We just needed people to understand that they
                            deserved a coffee which was worth the work they did
                            all day. A luxury, if you may. We pitched the idea
                            to Mboso and he gave us a green flag.

                            idea of coffee being a luxury to savour and be
                            enjoyed like it is supposed to be. Mboso’s story was
                            circulated in various forms which helped people to

                            out to be a success with a 25% increase in lead
                            generation and a 10% increase in product sales.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            These numbers kept rising as we continued and Mboso
                            Enterprises was a success.
                          </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 className="font-[700] my-2">Conclusion:</h2>
                        <p>
                          Mboso’s case was a matter of huge learning for us. We
                          understood how stories sold more than products. It
                          also gave us great insights into foreign audiences and
                          business workflow. This also taught us that people
                          with small businesses and startups can do wonders if
                          guided by someone who knows how to get things done.

                      <p>
                        This is the case of SalesUp, an Indian startup with a
                        vision to revolutionize affiliate marketing. The startup
                        owners were already trying for a year before they
                        approached us. They were trying to build a social media
                        profile but it was a mess. As they told us about their
                        goals, we started analyzing their social media. They
                        wanted to generate leads through social media.
                      </p>

                      <h2 className="font-[700] my-2">Challenges:</h2>
                      <p>
                        We figured out the problems they were having. They were
                        the following:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Their posts weren’t niche-specific.</li>
                        <li>They didn’t have any branding whatsoever.</li>
                        <li>They had no theme in colour or design.</li>
                        <li>They did no engagement whatsoever.</li>
                        <li>There was no content strategy.</li>
                        <li>
                          The posts were not informative and eye-grabbing.
                        </li>
                        <li>There was no regularity in posting.</li>
                        <li>And a few more.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h2 className="font-[700] my-2">Our Approach:</h2>
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          <strong>New Strategies:</strong> We made new social
                          media strategies for them and started experimenting.
                          We understood their ideal audience and framed our
                          strategies accordingly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Branding:</strong> We specifically designed
                          posts for them and with their approval, chose the
                          branding colours and designs. At first, they were
                          dubious about us. We changed things and that is always
                          a pain point. But we asked them to trust us and give
                          us some time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Content Strategy:</strong> With this, we made
                          a content strategy for a week and developed a few
                          posts. These posts were informative and explained what
                          affiliate marketing is and its various factors.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Developing a CTA:</strong> They lacked a
                          Call-to-action in their posts. They simply used to put
                          in their phone numbers. But we changed that to
                          directing potential leads towards their website.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Social Media Management:</strong> There were
                          other improvements like story posting, DMs, and
                          engaging with followers and other creators.
                        </li>
                      </ol>

                      <h2 className="font-[700] my-2">Results:</h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Within a week of rebranding and changing their social
                          media, their followers increased and so did their
                          likes and comments. But they weren’t happy with the
                          results. Their goal was lead generation, not to gain
                          followers and accumulate likes. But we reassured them
                          that it was part of our strategy. Engagement is the
                          first step towards lead generation. This was the time
                          of make or break. But SalesUp chose to trust us and
                          give us more time. This decision turned out to be a
                          breakthrough for them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Within the next two weeks, their lead generation saw a
                          massive rise of 300% and their conversions also
                          increased by 100%.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          They had 150 people working with them before our
                          services and after a month of working with us, they
                          had a network of 500+ people.
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <h2 className="font-[700] my-2">Conclusion:</h2>
                      <p>
                        These specific strategies for things that most people
                        ignore and that SalesUp was ignoring too, helped the
                        company to get to new heights fast.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This is one out of many success stories that we were a
                        part of, as Revibe Academy. As months passed by, we
                        started getting offers from foreign startups as well.
                        This brought us a new challenge. These companies
                        required services, ideas, and methods that were
                        different from the Indian startup space. This helped us
                        broaden our vision. One such company was Mboso
                        Enterprises.

                          cybersecurity solutions to businesses of all sizes.
                          Established with the mission to enhance digital safety
                          and protect organizations from cyber threats, SESC
                          initially faced challenges in effectively reaching and

                          Despite offering cutting-edge digital security
                          services, SESC struggled with its marketing efforts.
                          The company's groundbreaking ideas and robust
                          cybersecurity solutions were not effectively
                          communicated to potential clients. This resulted in a
                          lack of visibility in the competitive cybersecurity
                          market and hindered their growth prospects.
                          Recognizing the need to revamp its marketing strategy
                          and enhance client acquisition, SESC solicited Arka

                          This success of Arka Consultancy had us thinking that
                          it was time to expand. So, in June 2024, we switched
                          our business model from freelance work to a full-time
                          employee-based company. Hence, the process of hiring
                          experts and interns started.

                        <p>
                          Now, let’s come back to the question stated in the
                          beginning—What is Luxury? Luxury is ease. If the work
                          gets done in the least tiresome manner, it is a
                          luxury. If you don’t need to approach tons of people
                          for tons of work, it is a luxury. If you are provided
                          with everything you need and want by just one provider
                          with no headaches of management, it is a luxury.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          And here, at Arka Consultancy, our services give you
                          ease. Our services, provide you with luxury.
